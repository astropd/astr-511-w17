\title{ {\bf Term Project \# 1}}  
                   
\centerline{Galactic Astronomy (Astr 511); Winter Quarter 2017}
\centerline{prof. Mario Juri\'{c} and prof. \v{Z}eljko Ivezi\'{c}, University of Washington} 

The text data file Astr511HW1data.dat (linked to class webpage as
a gzipped file) contains SDSS measurements for 
about 600,000 stars with $b>80^\circ$ (i.e. within 10$^\circ$ 
from the north galactic pole) and $14<r<21$. The data are listed as one line
per star, with each line containing the following quantities:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf ra dec:} right ascension and declination (J2000.0)
 in decimal degrees 
\item {\bf run:} SDSS observing night identifier
\item {\bf Ar:} the value of the $r$ band ISM extinction used to 
     correct photometry (adopted from the SFD maps; for bands 
     other than $r$ standard SDSS coefficients are used)
\item {\bf u g r i z:} SDSS photometry (corrected for the ISM
       extinction)
\item {\bf uErr gErr rErr iErr zErr:} photometric errors
\item {\bf pmL pmB:} proper motion vector components in the
      longitudinal and latitudinal directions (mas/yr); set to
      999.99 when no measurement is available 
\item {\bf pmErr:} mean proper motion error (mas/yr); set to
      999.99 when no measurement is available 
\end{itemize}

For stars from this file, compute absolute magnitude using
a photometric parallax relation, $M_r(g-i,[Fe/H])$, given
by eqs. A2, A3 and A7 from Ivezi\'{c} et al. 2008 (ApJ, 684, 287).
For computing metallicity, $[Fe/H]$, instead of their
eq.~4, use an updated expression from Bond et al. 2010 (ApJ, 716, 1): 
\begin{equation}
\label{Zphotom}
  [Fe/H] = A + Bx + Cy + Dxy  + Ex^2 + Fy^2 + Gx^2 y + Hxy^2 + Ix^3 + Jy^3,
\end{equation}
with $x=(u-g)$ and $y=(g-r)$, and the best-fit coefficients ($A$--$J$) = 
($-$13.13, 14.09, 28.04, $-$5.51, $-$5.90, $-$58.68, 9.14, $-$20.61, 0.0,
58.20). This expression if valid only for $g-r<0.6$; for redder stars
use $[Fe/H]=-0.6$. 

Since $b>80^\circ$, for these stars the distance from the galactic plane, $Z$,
and the distance from us, $D$, are approximately the same. Using $Z=D$, where
$D$ is computed from $r-M_r= 5*\log{\left(D/({\rm 10 pc})\right)}$, do the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item For stars with $0.2<g-r<0.4$, plot $\ln(\rho)$ vs. $Z$, where 
  $\rho$ is the stellar number density in a given bin (e.g. look at 
  Figs. 5 and 15 in Juri\'{c} et al. 2008, ApJ, 673, 864 for similar
  examples). You can approximate
  $\rho(Z) = N(Z)/V(Z)$, where $N(Z)$ is the number of stars in a given
  bin, and $V(Z)$ is the bin volume (note that the solid angle is 
  $\Delta \Omega \sim 314$ deg$^2$). What is the $Z$ range where you
  believe the results for  $\rho(Z)$, and why?
\item Add $\ln(\rho)$ vs. $Z$ for stars with $0.4<g-r<0.6$, $0.6<g-r<0.8$,
      and $0.8<g-r<1.0$ (you can rescale all curves to the same value
      at some fiducial $Z$, or leave them as they are). Discuss the 
      differences compared to the $0.2<g-r<0.4$ subsample. Why do we
      expect larger systematic errors for $0.8<g-r<1.0$ than for the
      adjacent bin with $0.4<g-r<0.6$?
\item For subsample with $0.2<g-r<0.4$, separate stars into low-metallicity
      sample, $[Fe/H]<-1.0$, and high-metallicity sample, $[Fe/H]>-1.0$. 
      Compare their $\ln(\rho)$ vs. $Z$ curves. What do you conclude?
\item For these low-metallicity and high-metallicity samples, plot and 
      compare their differential $r$ band magnitude distributions (i.e. the 
      number of sources per unit magnitude, in small, say 0.1 mag wide, $r$
      bins). What do you conclude? How would you numerically describe 
      these curves (i.e. what kind of functional form for the fitting
      functions would you choose)? 
\item What should be the faint $r$ band limit for a survey to be able to
      map the $\ln(\rho)$ vs. $Z$ profile out to 100 kpc using main-sequence
      stars? Assume the same color distribution as for the SDSS sample. 
      For a solid angle of 1 deg$^2$, how many stars with $0.2<g-r<0.4$
      would you expect with distances between 90 kpc and 100 kpc? 
      Assume whatever additional information you need to solve this 
      problem (not all required information is provided here).
\end{enumerate}
